# overview

basically, I read about things, and it seems this is more scalable and better organization than our previous folder structure

# specifics

api - for interacting with the backend

assets - media, fonts

common - components, utils that are used by multiple features

features - contains folders of a coherent functionality we are implementing. Can consist of one or more pages, or could just be a complicated functionality that deserves its own folder

hooks - for encapsulating state; for reuse & for readability between components

navigation - self explanatory

styles - specific styling

types - if we start using typescript

contexts - for globally accessible functions, use responsibly
