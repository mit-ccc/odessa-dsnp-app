    $ we decide to structure by feature rather than quickstart components/screens/etc in order to modularize and make it more scalable. Additionally, it should be easy for people to work on different things simultaneously, and plug & play.
    $ major vs minor component rather than importing feature from feature. still a bit clunky. Maybe features shouldn't be organized around the screens, but that's another layer ... 
        or we could make both the archive and landing the same feature, and make two screens. But then it is weird having it be the home screen.
