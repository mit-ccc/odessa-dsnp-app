# Outline of Setup, with Common Pitfalls
1) Clone the repo
2) Install node for your os
3) go to the subdirectory (OdessaApp) with package.json, and run (npm i)
4) download android studio giraffe
5) open android studio, download the correct pixel (Pixel 5, API 33, Android 13.0) via more actions -> Virtual Device Manager -> Create Device
6) in OdessaApp, run (npx react-native doctor), you need checkmarks next to Adb and JDK <br> 6a) If no JDK, you must set the $JAVA_HOME variable. This will be something like /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home (jbr=jetbrains) <br> 6b) if no Adb, you must set the $ANDROID_HOME variable. This will be something like /Users/_username/Library/Android/sdk
7) from OdessaApp, run (npm start). You should see the image and rdia options, press a to run on android <br> 7a) might take a while for first time. If you get the error crypto.getRnadomValues must be defined, go to Storage.js and comment out the lines that use the package. We tried a fix in android/build.gradle, but doesn't seem to work for MacOS
8) get python system wide, and set up virtual env. It will just make a folder. Name it venv, it is the standard, and is already included in .gitignore 
9) do the pip-tools install, pip-compile, pip-sync for startup, and any time you add a dependency
10) if having trouble with the postgres and psql installation (mac) then you should just brew install postgres
11) install docker if you haven't, then compose up and invoke the seed data, run uvicorn (in the services directory) and try to insert using psql 
11.a) remember semicolons
12) try to query and insert using graphQL -- access using the localhost address from when you started the server
